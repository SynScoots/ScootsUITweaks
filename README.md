- For prestiged players with an attune mastery greater than 0%, item tooltips for non-soulbound attuneable items of the "wrong type" will display their attunement progress.
- For users with the TomTom addon installed, a button to automatically convert pins added via the world map tracking panel to waypoints is added to the tracking panel.
